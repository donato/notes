# Bi-Weekly meeting

First priority is getting an RC out for 1.5

* 5 outstanding PRs
- need someone to decide which will get pulled in and which won't (this is behind schedule)
- then lock down

Process
* They want to do more patch releases for bugfixes, since major releases occur once per 3 months
* discussion on removing minified files from repo

Sprint Planning Session on Sept 15th
