## v 1.5 Planning

* Discuss surfacing internal events, such as manifest refresh

### Baseurl
We use the baseurl when we think the mpd file will not work.

Should we have an API for how many times to retry before falling back to baseurl?
 * Would people actually use it?
 * Is the challenge how many times to do it, or how long to wait?
 * Should we have a delay between retries?
 * We don't need to handle everything, lets **do one thing well**


### Mulitiple audio tracks
Default from the stream vs from the client
do a fuzzy match?
having an API for this seems important


### TrickPlay
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick_mode
* http://open.pbs.org/blogs/open-pbs/how-pbs-is-enabling-apples-trick-play-mode/
* If we have requirements on how this should work, get in touch with Karishma

Given a standard manifest, we include a trickplay track for the same video which includes keyframes only

### Bugs
* A few safari bugs

## v1.6?
Dijon
ES6
