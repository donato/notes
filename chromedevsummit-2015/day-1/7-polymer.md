# Polymer State of the Union
Taylor Savage

## Since last year
Last year was v0.8
Shifted away from experimentation into more usable for production.
In May they released v1.0
 * Redisgned Data binding
 * Rebuilt smaller and faster

Polymer is a web component library

 * Element product lines
 * Paper - reference for material design
 * Iron - Web forms auto completion
 * Platinum - service workers
 * Carbon - structure of an app without a ton of opinions (such as layouts)

## It's gonna happen
 * Edge - finished templates, working on shadow dom
 * Mozilla - in planning for years, but still planning to do it
 * webkit - early betas of shadow dom ready for testing

## What's changed since v1.0
 * Over 1M sites use polymer now
 * GE is using polymer to build components which can be combined into reports or dashboards
 * net-a-porter.com is using it to great effect in responsive ecommerce

## v1.2
 * Improve ergonomics and performance,
 * but every feature has a cost
 * The web is now a 1st-class developer platform

## Next
 * Right now it is meant to be a scalpal which works excellently for experts, but is it easy for everyone?
 * In the future they want to make it easier to build and share components.

 * polydev : visibility into performance of components to see how they contribute to overall performance of your application
