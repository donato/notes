Tal Oppenheimer

## Context
  * 3.2 Billion internet users
  * We imagine it's mostly USA and a little of Europe
  * Wrong - China is bigger and India is close with massive growth
  * Main focus for Internet user growth is India
    - Some of these are first-time users
    - Some have never and will never use a desktop
    - Devices are significently weaker in RAM and memory
    - Stuck on 2G internet (62% of the world)
        * **We should progressive enhance from a regular video tag**
        
# Do it better
  * Deep linking - Link directly to where they want to be, instead of having steps
  * Once they actually get to the experience, minimize data usage
  * Detect power-save mode 
    - give them only critical images
    - remove auto play
    - change resolution
