# DevTools in 2015: Authoring to the max
Paul Bakaus

Designer of dev tools : Max @maxwkr

## Making it a joy to use
Improve the UI

 * UI to UH - user hinderface
 * Reorder tabs possible
 * Updates to menu options
 
## Make authoring fast and intuitive
 * Add color to elements from dev tools
 * Eye dropper for selecting color from the page
 * Can view color pallettes as well
 * Shades via a long-press on a color
 * Hovering over a selector will highlight all matched elements
 * Add a line to the color picker which shows the color contrast level for accessibility
 
## More power to js developers
 * Mobile emulation - Mobile FIRST!
 * Responsive design testing
 * Throttling enabled in the network panel
 * Chrome inspect is old, now you can do it from within devtools in the "more" menu
 
Rule of thumb:
    "A visual design practice is out of fashion around the same time it is available by browsers in CSS"
  
 * Crazy cool animation tool for CSS, allowing rewind/fastforward
    - enable "dev tools experiments" from chrome canary - looking for feedback
    
 * Black boxing scripts
 * Framework event listener (Look into this)
 * Object formatters

"Isn't this the service worker conference?"
 * Service workers is behind the resources tab, filtering to only the ones you are interested
 * You can simulate a push here
 

## (Bonus) Layout Mode
WYSIWYG for dev tools

 * Allows you to adjust margins/padding on a page
