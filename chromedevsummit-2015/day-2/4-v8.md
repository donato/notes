# V8 Performance from the Driver's Seat

## Improvements in the Engine
 * Optimizing compiler - "turbo fan"
     - Chrome has multiple compilers, which are chosen based on the method
     - Hotter methods may use more expensive compilers
     - This uses a "Sea of Nodes" which allows easier access to attributes
     - It allows optimization ES2015
     - It uses static type information to optimize asm.js (and soon WebAssembly)
 * Better GC
     - Blinks scheduler can now talk to V8 to know when to collect garbage without jank
     - 
 * Ignition
     - On low memory devices, use a lower performance but memory efficient engine

## Frameworks
 * In the future the team want's to optimize for patterns that frameworks use
 * Historically they just focused on native js

## How to use 'em
 1. Understand how modern engines work
     - Don't change the shape of an object, since they are using structs and it has to rewrite them
     - Don't change the return-type of a function
 1. Tools not rules
     - IRHydra - shows how machine code comes from code
     - You can use node if it's version of V8 is the same as the browser
     - ```node --trace-deopt```
 1. Communicate weth engine implementors
    - Submit benchmarks and they will optimize for it!
