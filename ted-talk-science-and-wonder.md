## Danielle Feinberg
Director of Photography-lighting @ Pixar

Modern animation relies on a backbone of physics to create the realism
which immerses people into them. When things move too fast, or don't
follow the rules we expect to see (such as gravity), it's jarring to the viewer.

Lighting is accomplished by first simulating reality and then bending the rules
to best to tell a story. This is where it branches away from the mathematical
and formulaic and into the realm of artistry and fantastic.

We see some pretty amazing examples of how lighting can change a scene from
factual to emotional. Some of the most poignant images were of Wall-E, ratatouille, 
and finding Nemo.

Then we went deep into a few case studies of how the nuances of lighting can tell different
stories. When designing Wall-E, the original eyes were photo-realistic binoculars with three
levels of lens'. It looked cool, but not soul-ful. The adjective used was "glossy-eyed." They
knew this didn't show life, and actually ended up using it for a scene where Wall-E loses his
personality. But when designing the binoculars to be able to express love, curiosity and longing
they needed something more.

The process of getting to the final lens design was thoughtful and persistent, but the final
breakthrough was actually an accident, when a lamp from a different part of the scene
reflected against his eyes showing an inner light. It was interesting to hear that since
his eyes were perfectly reflective they had to always be careful of what he was looking at
since it will make the shot even if it is off-scene.

The next example involved a scene involving jelly-fish. Here they bent the rules
of how light travels through water in order to give a longer length of of view.
This created a feeling of scale and enormity that wouldn't have been possible
when following physics exactly.


## Juan Enriquez
Author - LIFECODE

The first millions of years of life on earth were guided by principles of
natural selection. Today we are tinkering and changing these ideas in a very
fundamental way. Wnat we are doing isn't good or bad, but it is certainly not natural.

To begin with, consider the equation, 
    Male Genitalia + Female Genitalia = Baby

When we introduced "the pill" into this equation, we changed a fundamental law of nature.
Decoupling sex from reproduction. With artificial insemination we decouple it in the same way.
There are other cases where people have 3 parents, in order to protect from genetic defects.
Where it gets weird is with frozen sperm and eggs, when we decouple reproduction 
from time itself. With this new equation, twins could be born 100 years apart.

We are slightly mislead by the ideas of natural things. Natural cauliflower, 
Kale and broccoli are all descendants of a plant which mankind has carefully guided.

No longer are we letting the strongest thing survive, instead we are choosing what
is most convenient to us. Corn fields are the polar opposite of the bio-diversity that
constitutes any truly natural environment.

LifeCode is the idea of mindfully controlling what life is.
It's important to understand that we are already doing this, it isn't
black magic, and as such we should pay attention to it instead of ignoring it.


Principles of LifeCode
1. Accept and understand what we are doing isn't natural
2. Be part of the conversation
3. Respect other peoples desire to partake or not partake in it
4. Set aside 25% of diverse earth to let darwin keep going
5. ..?


## Arati Prabhakar
Director, DARPA

She began by giving us a nice overview of what DARPA actually does,
which ranges from solving military problems, to imagining the world of tomorrow.
Their accomplishments include building the internet, neutron detectors,
explosion proof cars and lately new neuro-technologies.

Arati believes that the next big game-changer will be how technology interfaces with
people. The human brain is basically a supercomputer, being forced to communicate with
the super-computers of today via a keyboard and mouse. As antiquated as a dial-up modem.

DARPA has been experimenting with direct interfaces to the brain, two of which she shared
with us. The first was a woman paralyzed from the neck down, who controls a prosthetic arm
using only her mind. There is some form of chip embedded into her brain. She uses this to
feed herself a bar of chocolate - a pretty incredible feat. The next experiment was giving
feedback directly back into the brain, allowing a similarly paralyzed soldier to "sense"
when the fingers of his prosthetic hand were being touched. He could even distinguish 
specifically which finger was being touched.

Is there a future where human enhancement becomes ubiquitous the same way the internet is?
Nobody imagined a decade ago that access to the internet would become a "basic human right"
and yet it has. What if in the future, access to memory and intellectual enhancement is the same?
What if there is a divide between the haves and the have-nots of embedded neuro-interfaces?

From here we took a philosophical turn. Is all this okay? Is there a line that
we shouldn't cross? Whose job is it to define and defend this line? Will there be
a future where enhanced soldiers can control their heart-rate via brainchips to maintain
focus for longer time? Will we need some type of Geneva Convention to regulate the usage
of neural enhancements in war?
