# Organizational Design for OSS - Jory Burson
COO of Bocoup talks about challenges to creating human organizations around software development

### How to approach a challenge?
1. Do we have an objective/goal?
2. What combination of resources are needed to achieve it?
3. How do the entities exchange information?

 * These incorporate all the operational challenges 
    - how to do code review
    - how to list dependencies
    
 * Leads to questions like
    - how do we get more collaborators?
    - how to handle I.P.?
    
Here we talk about the *human systems* as opposed to the technical systems
    
    M - Mission
        An entities mission doesn't change over time. There should be one for every person, project and team
    V - Value
        Is it quantitative? How much money to raise? Humans need qualitative as well
    C - Change
        The means we execute to achieve the mission
    
### Everything is connected
* technical success may lead to social failure
* complex systems fail
* always strive for simplicity

### Case study - Node
 * in 2012, Mikeal Rogers believes node was in a great position of growth
 * by 2014, node is forked due to political problems - people wanted changes but couldn't make them
 * today, io and node.js are trying to restore
 * [Open governance model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_governance)
    - open participation
    - open and transparent technical decision making
 * people are intrinsically against centralized power
 * we need to balance fear of chaos with fear of centralized power
    - THIS IS ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN (Governance + Purpose)

### Organizational Design
1. Purpose - Declare it, and reread it often. Share it in your README. Make it prominent.
2. Governance - structures that provide, 
    * corporate form - a group of people (company, standards body or foundation) that is treated as one)
    * decision making structures - the "who" and "how" they make decisions. 
        - benevolent dictatorship?
        - collaboration? - ie standards orgs
        - anything?
        - ES takes recommendations from standards organizations
        - ** This can change over time **
    * decision enforcement structures
        - proactive - testing suites
        - reactive - reinforce after exposure, like CLAs or Codes of Conduct
        
### Applying organizational design to OSS
1. Simplicity
    * Precision with tasks
    * Don't try to solve everything up front
        - throw good errors
2. Flexibility
    * Let people change how they approach goals
3. Reliability
    * Consistency in operations and output
    * Don't surprise the people who rely on it
    * As important as innovation (balance of stability vs growth)
4. Acceptability
    * Peoples general acceptance of the system
    * Stop and make sure you have buy-in from the organization
        - resistence is a human error message
   
Conways Law - organizations which design systems ... 
are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations
