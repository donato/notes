### Foundation
* Be nice, treat people well, be service oriented
* Give people the tools to help themselves
* Your family is a community, your work is a community, your city is a community

### What's a meetup?
* An outlet to talk dev stuff outside of work
* A place to learn and to share
* A **good** meetup is about the members, not the code
* A **good** meetup keeps people engaged

### How
* The cathedral & the bazaar - Eric Raymond
* Let people partipate in the way that they want to
    - teaching, learning, become a better version of ourselves
* Adapt to the context, split into new, or combine and merge them
* Avoid recruiting

### Steps
* Share the load across multiple people
* Have a code of conduct
* Be consistent
* You'll need
    - A space
        + local colleges are a good option for spaces
        + small meetups could use a coffee shop or brewery or anything!
    - Internet
    - Projector
    - Pizza
    - Shared calenders/documents
    - Social Media
    - Email list (including calendar attachments)
    - Meetup.com
* Always measure engagement of people
* Pivot through different topics until you find ones that attracts interest
    - For example "geek dinners"
    - For example, build an OSS project together, they built a pastebin clone
        + For them they tripled engagement through this
* Use your human resources at hand
    - Invite people to talk here, or invite your friends (even if they aren't devs)
    - Coworkers, but do this carefully without harassing them
    - Fellow meetup attendees - ask them to present something
* Go to regional meetups, even driving an hour or so
