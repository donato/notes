## ES 2016 - Jafar Husain
Tech lead of netflix, architect of falcor

Aside - ES6 has been renamed ES 2015, to encourage faster feature trains

```js
    // fun lambdas
    getStock('F', (left, right) { ... });
```

### What is ES 2016?
 * Better and easier async functions
 * Blocking is easy, but what if we could do async w/out callbacks?
 * --Idea-- Blocking is kind of like Pulling
 * One problem w/ waiting, is try/catch, because each level is responsible for forwarding up the errors
    - First attempt in ES15 is promises
    - 2nd try is using generators, "yield"

### Pushing and Pulling are symetrical
 * A generator is a function that can return multiple values
    - yield is an intermediary return
    - it knows every possible state that it could be in, its like building a state machine
    - Big idea is that you write functions as if they are pushing data out, but gives you the owner of the iterator
        to pull out when they want to

### Generator can be more
* It is an iterator but ALSO an observer
    - because you can push data into it
    
```js
        generator.next(5)   // This replaces the return value of the yielded method
        generator.throw(5)
        generator.return(5)
```

* This gives you the power of async iteration


### Observer
    // Consume a data stream
    var nums().observer({
        next(v)  : {},
        return() : {},
        throw()  : {}
    }
    
Question : If we use babel to attempt this, and then it's removed from the standard, will it be removed from babel?

    function* getKeyFrames(video) {
        var allFrames = yield getFrames(video);
        var keyFrames = yield filterKeys(allFrames);
        return keyFrames;
    }
```
